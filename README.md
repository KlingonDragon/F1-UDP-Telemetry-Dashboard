## Versions

### 2021
This is the old dashboard I made last year. It works, but the code isn't great, and the app doesn't work with all screen sizes.
I've made a few updates to the directory structure and modified the code to support the new image locations but I don't plan to update this any further.

### ~~2022~~
I never made a 2022 version because I found the game incredibly frustrating to play. 2023 is far better so I'm resuming this project with that version.

### 2023
I'm creating a new dashboard for this year's game based on this year's data.
